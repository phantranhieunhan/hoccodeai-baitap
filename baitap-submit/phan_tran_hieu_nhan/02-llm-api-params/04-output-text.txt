According to a Politico article dated August 17, President Alexander Stubb of Finland—one of the leaders who has maintained an open line of communication with former U.S. President Donald Trump—was scheduled to accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on his visit to Washington on August 18. European diplomatic circles expect Mr. Stubb’s presence to help ease tensions while ensuring that Europe retains a voice in discussions about Ukraine’s future.

Earlier, the meeting between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Elmendorf‑Richardson Air Force Base in Alaska on August 15 failed to produce any breakthrough. Trump announced his intention to host President Zelensky at the White House and to invite both Russian and Ukrainian leaders to a three‑party dialogue aimed at reaching a peace agreement. However, Moscow has yet to issue an official statement confirming whether Mr. Putin will meet directly with Mr. Zelensky.

European officials argue that the outcome of the Alaska talks heightened concerns, as Mr. Trump appeared to adopt some arguments from the Russian side. Former senior NATO officer Camille Grand noted: “The meeting was not a disaster, but it is clear that Europe is uneasy about the current trajectory. Therefore they are trying to avoid any adverse scenarios in President Zelensky’s forthcoming visit.”  

During the Alaska summit, Mr. Trump abandoned his earlier warnings of imposing harsh sanctions on Russia and ceased demanding an immediate cease‑fire. Instead, he emphasized a “comprehensive agreement” with language that was more aligned with Moscow’s position. He also advised Kyiv to “accept the settlement,” although no specifics were provided.

To prevent a repeat of the passive scenario seen at the February White House meeting—when President Zelensky faced sharp criticism from both President Trump and Vice‑President John D. Vance—the European allies have devised a tighter support plan. In addition to Finnish President Stubb, NATO Secretary‑General Mark Rutte could also attend the Washington visit.

At the same time, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to chair an online meeting with the “voluntary alliance”—a group of countries committed to providing military and security assistance to Ukraine following the conflict.

**Vietnam’s 80‑Year Agricultural Journey**

The 80‑year journey represents a continuous effort by Vietnam and its people—a narrative forged through sweat, ambition, and intellect from farmers, scientists, and the political system alike. Professor Đặng Kim Sơn of the Market Research Institute and Agricultural Systems Academy evaluates this trajectory: over the past eight decades, agriculture has emerged as a pivotal sector driving socio‑economic development at each historical phase.

“We have secured food security; we have become an export powerhouse for rice and various other agricultural products. We have successfully eliminated poverty, reduced inequality, and ensured economic and social stability… These are outstanding achievements of Vietnam’s agricultural sector throughout its history,” Professor Đặng Kim Sơn emphasizes.

Rice has long been regarded as a “precious grain” because of the enduring hardships and prolonged hunger that plagued the country for many years. The 100‑year period up to 1981, followed by the decade-long reform in 1988, marked a breakthrough in agricultural management reforms. After more than forty years of chronic food insecurity, Vietnam, driven by innovative thinking, exported its first shipment of rice to the world in 1989. That tiny grain became the flagship commodity that put Vietnam’s name on the international stage and paved the way for a succession of Vietnamese agricultural products to continue the country’s mission as a major exporter.

In reality, every sector of agriculture—crop production, animal husbandry, aquaculture—has achieved remarkable progress over the past eight decades and has made substantial contributions to overall development. Speaking about livestock, Professor Nguyen Xuan Duong, Chairman of the Vietnam Livestock Association, noted that Vietnam’s livestock sector ranks highly in the region and globally: “Vietnam’s pork herd is sixth in the world, and its production volume ranks seventh—an impressive figure for a small country like ours. Moreover, our aquaculture and fish farming sector is second worldwide, just behind China. The feed industry and dairy processing are leaders among ASEAN countries,” he emphasized.

Aquaculture, one of Vietnam’s core export sectors generating tens of billions of dollars annually, continues to make strides that contribute nearly a quarter of the agriculture GDP; it ranks third globally in aquaculture exports and fourth in export volume. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Vietnam is world‑leading in cashew nut exports; second worldwide in rice and coffee; third in vegetables; and fourth in seafood. Many flagship products have penetrated highly selective markets such as the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. Beyond volume, Vietnam has shifted focus to high‑quality agricultural goods, positioning a number of “Vietnamese brand” products—including ST25 rice, specialty coffee, organic shrimp, and deep‑processed fruit—on the global stage.

It can be said that the key driver behind these milestones in agriculture is the Party’s designation of agriculture as a priority front, accompanied by a series of policies enacted since the post‑reform era. Over time, agricultural, farmer, and rural policies have evolved from a production mindset to an agrarian‑economic perspective. Resolution No. 19‑NQ/TW dated 16 June 2022 on Agriculture, Farmers, and Rural Areas to 2030, with a vision to 2045, established agriculture, farmers, and rural areas as foundational pillars and critical forces for national development. The Sustainable Rural Development Strategy to 2030, with a 2045 vision, also sets the goal of making Vietnam a leading nation in processed agricultural exports while integrating production with environmental protection, emission reduction, robust application of science and technology, and digital transformation.

Professor/Doctor Nguyen Do Anh Tuan, Head of the International Cooperation Department at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, evaluates:

The integration of science and technology with institutional frameworks serves as a lever that enables Vietnamese agriculture to break new ground—ensuring not only food‑security stability but also participation in the global supply chain with high‑quality, branded products.

According to Dr Lê Quốc Thanh, Director of the National Agricultural Research Center, throughout the country’s history successive generations of agricultural scientists have endeavoured to contribute to Vietnam’s agrarian miracle. “From developing new plant and animal varieties to establishing a robust seed system; from researching, transferring, and applying technological advances in production to harmonising solutions for processes, technology protocols, and—most importantly—scientific approaches to innovation, organisational design, and production connectivity—these efforts have propelled Vietnamese agriculture forward and positioned it within the global supply chain as a producer of quality, branded goods,” Dr Lê Quốc Thanh emphasised.
